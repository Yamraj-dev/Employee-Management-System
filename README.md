# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Employee Management System
This Employee Management System allows admins to assign tasks to employees and monitor their progress. The system features an admin dashboard where you can see who is doing what, while employees can view their own task status on their dashboard, including new tasks, completed work, and failed work.

Features:
Admin Dashboard: Admins can assign tasks to employees and view their progress.
Employee Dashboard: Employees can view new tasks, completed tasks, and failed tasks.
Task Management: Easily track the status of each task.
Technologies Used:
React: The frontend is built using React.js for a dynamic user interface.
React Router: Used for navigation between pages.
Tailwind CSS: For responsive and customizable styling.
Vite: A fast and efficient build tool for development and production.
The project is mostly complete, though there are some minor issues that I plan to address later.
